        Attentive is an online tool that helps teachers to determine a studentâ€™s level of
         engagement and focus during a class. It creates a report describing the amount of
          time spent on an assignment, the average attention span of the student, and times
           when the student was distracted. This can be used to improve online learning and 
           ensure that students are being taught knowledge they will need throughout their lives.
