         No matter how much an individual swear that he/she won’t be “that person,” it seems every smartphone
         user eventually becomes chained to their phone.
         Studies show most smartphone users keep their devices within arm’s reach all day, every day.
         Every few minutes, even if the phone didn’t vibrate or sound an alert,
         he/she feel obligated to check for updates on the tiny computers we keep close.
         Smartphones are increasingly addictive and distracting, and as a result it’s getting 
         harder for people to pay attention to what they’re doing.<br/>
         <b>Ekagrata</b> is the web app which helps students to increase their level of concentration while 
         solving assignments assigned by the teacher using Google Classroom and generates the report containing the
         total amount of time the student was disracted.
